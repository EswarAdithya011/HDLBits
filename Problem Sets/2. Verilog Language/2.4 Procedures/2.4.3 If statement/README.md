## Always If â€“ 2-to-1 Multiplexer using `assign` and `if` statement

This problem illustrates how both **continuous assignments** and **procedural `if` statements** can be used to create multiplexers. You will build the same logic twice: once with an `assign` statement, and once with an `always` block.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- A **2-to-1 multiplexer** selects one of two inputs based on a condition.
- Using `assign` with the **ternary operator (`? :`)** is concise and synthesizes cleanly.
- Using `if` inside an `always @(*)` block allows for more flexibility, especially with complex conditions.
- A **combinational always block must assign all outputs** for all conditions to avoid creating unintended latches.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Create a 2-to-1 mux with the following:

- Inputs: `a`, `b`, `sel_b1`, `sel_b2`
- Outputs:
  - `out_assign`: Implemented with an `assign` statement.
  - `out_always`: Implemented with an `always @(*)` and `if` statement.

The logic:
- Output `b` if both `sel_b1` and `sel_b2` are 1.
- Otherwise, output `a`.

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This problem reinforces how **logic control flow** can be described in Verilog using both dataflow (`assign`) and procedural (`always`) approaches. Ensuring that **every output is assigned under all conditions** is crucial to prevent latch inference in synthesis.
