## AlwaysBlock2 â€“ XOR Gate with `assign`, `always @(*)`, and `always @(posedge clk)`

This exercise extends your understanding of **combinational and sequential always blocks** by showing how the same logic (XOR) can behave differently when placed in different types of constructs.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **assign**: Drives wires with continuous logic.
- **Combinational always** (`always @(*)`): Implements pure logic evaluated continuously, uses `reg` and **blocking** assignments (`=`).
- **Sequential always** (`always @(posedge clk)`): Implements logic updated only on clock edges, uses **non-blocking** assignments (`<=`), and introduces **state** via flip-flops.
- This exercise demonstrates that the **same operation (XOR)** produces different behavior based on the block type.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Create a module with:

- Inputs: `a`, `b`, `clk`
- Outputs:
  - `out_assign`: computed via `assign`
  - `out_always_comb`: computed via `always @(*)`
  - `out_always_ff`: computed via `always @(posedge clk)`

Observe how `out_always_ff` introduces a **one-cycle delay** due to clocking.

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Understanding the timing and behavior differences between assign statements, combinational logic, and clocked logic is fundamental in RTL design. Itâ€™s critical when designing **pipelined, synchronous**, or **state-based** digital systems.
