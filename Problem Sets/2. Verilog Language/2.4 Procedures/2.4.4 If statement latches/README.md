## Always If2 â€“ Preventing Unintended Latches in Combinational Logic

This problem focuses on a **common mistake** when writing combinational logic using procedural `always` blocks â€” failing to assign outputs in all conditions, which leads to **unintentional latch inference**.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- In **combinational logic**, all outputs **must be assigned** a value in **every possible condition**.
- Failing to do so causes synthesis tools to infer **latches** to "remember" the output value.
- A proper fix is either:
  - Provide an `else` clause.
  - Assign a **default value** before the conditional logic.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
You are given incorrect behavioral code that causes latch inference due to missing `else` blocks. Fix the bugs so that:

- `shut_off_computer` is **1** only when `cpu_overheated` is **1**; otherwise **0**.
- `keep_driving` is **1** only when `~arrived` and `~gas_tank_empty`; otherwise **0**.

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This problem emphasizes that **procedural `always @(*)` blocks must not omit conditions**. Either use a default assignment at the top of the block or complete the conditional structure. This practice **avoids synthesis warnings** and ensures **hardware behaves predictably**.
