## Always NoLatches â€“ Arrow Key Decoder from Scancode

This problem illustrates a key practice in hardware design: **avoiding latch inference** by ensuring **all outputs are assigned** in all cases of a combinational logic block.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- When using `always @(*)`, outputs must be assigned in **all possible execution paths**.
- Leaving out assignments for some paths leads to **unintended latches**, which can cause unreliable hardware.
- A clean method to avoid this is to **initialize all outputs to zero** before the case statement.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Build a circuit that detects arrow key presses from 16-bit PS/2 scancodes.

- **Input**:
  - `scancode[15:0]`: The last two bytes of scancode.
- **Outputs**:
  - `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`: Set to 1 if the corresponding key is detected; otherwise, 0.

| Scancode     | Arrow Key    |
|--------------|--------------|
| 16'he06b     | Left Arrow   |
| 16'he072     | Down Arrow   |
| 16'he074     | Right Arrow  |
| 16'he075     | Up Arrow     |
| Otherwise    | None (All 0) |

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Initializing all outputs to `1'b0` **before** the case block is a safe and clean method to prevent **latch inference**, especially when only one output is activated per condition. This ensures synthesis results in **pure combinational logic**.
