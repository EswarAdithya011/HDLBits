## Adder100i â€“ 100-bit Ripple-Carry Adder Using Full Adders

This problem builds a **100-bit ripple-carry adder** using **explicit instantiation of 100 full adder modules**. The goal is to deepen understanding of structural modeling in Verilog and how full adders can be chained to create large arithmetic units.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- A **ripple-carry adder** connects each full adder in series, where the carry-out of one becomes the carry-in of the next.
- This implementation requires:
  - **100 full adder instances**
  - Outputs for **individual carry-outs** (`cout`)
- This is an **example of hierarchical design** in Verilog.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Create a 100-bit adder as follows:

- **Inputs**:
  - `a[99:0]`, `b[99:0]`: 100-bit operands
  - `cin`: Initial carry-in
- **Outputs**:
  - `sum[99:0]`: Sum of a + b + cin
  - `cout[99:0]`: Carry-out from each full adder, where `cout[99]` is the final carry-out

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This problem introduces a real-world digital design pattern â€” **modular construction** using repeated instances. You can use a **generate loop** to avoid manually instantiating each full adder. This approach promotes cleaner, scalable code and matches how actual hardware is composed using reusable IP blocks or cells.
