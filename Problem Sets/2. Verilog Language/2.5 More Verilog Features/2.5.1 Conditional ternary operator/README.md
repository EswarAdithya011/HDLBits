## Conditional â€“ 4-Way Minimum using Ternary Operator

This problem highlights the use of Verilogâ€™s **conditional (ternary) operator** `(condition ? true_expr : false_expr)` to implement combinational logic efficiently.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- The ternary operator is useful for writing **compact and readable multiplexers** and decision logic.
- By chaining multiple ternary operations, complex comparisons like **finding the minimum of multiple numbers** can be composed.
- All expressions in a conditional statement must be **synthesizable** (no side effects or delays).

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Given four 8-bit **unsigned** inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, compute the **minimum value** among them using conditional (`? :`) operators.

- **Inputs**:
  - `a, b, c, d`: 8-bit unsigned integers.
- **Output**:
  - `min`: The smallest of the four values.

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise demonstrates how **multi-stage minimum comparisons** can be efficiently implemented with **chained ternary operators**, avoiding the verbosity of nested `if` statements or case structures while maintaining clean and synthesizable logic.
