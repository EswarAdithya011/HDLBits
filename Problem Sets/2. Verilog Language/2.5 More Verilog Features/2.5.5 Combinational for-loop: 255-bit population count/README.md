## Popcount255 â€“ 255-bit Population Counter

This problem focuses on computing the **population count**, also known as the **Hamming weight**, which is the total number of '1's present in a binary vector.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- For a 255-bit input, the goal is to **count all bits that are '1'**.
- A **`for` loop inside a combinational `always @(*)` block** efficiently accumulates the count.
- Since the maximum count from 255 bits is 255, the output should be at least **8 bits** wide.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Design a circuit to perform the following:

- **Input**:  
  - `in[254:0]`: A 255-bit input vector  
- **Output**:  
  - `out[7:0]`: Number of bits set to '1' in the input vector

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Population counting is common in **error correction**, **compression**, and **data analysis** hardware. The use of a **`for` loop** in Verilog allows summing a dynamic number of bits effectively, enabling scalable designs for wide input vectors.
