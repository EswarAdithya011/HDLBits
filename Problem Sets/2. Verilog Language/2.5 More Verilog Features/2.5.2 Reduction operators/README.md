## Reduction â€“ Even Parity Bit Generator

This problem introduces the **reduction operators** in Verilog to perform bitwise logic across all bits in a vector. It focuses on implementing **parity generation**, a fundamental concept in digital communication and error detection.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **Reduction operators** apply a logic operation across all bits of a vector and return a single-bit result:
  - `&` â€“ reduction AND
  - `|` â€“ reduction OR
  - `^` â€“ reduction XOR
- **Even parity** ensures that the total number of 1s (including the parity bit) is even.
- For even parity, the parity bit is the **XOR of all bits** in the byte.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Design a circuit to generate a **parity bit** for an 8-bit input using even parity.

- **Input**:
  - `in`: 8-bit data
- **Output**:
  - `parity`: 1-bit parity output (even parity)

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise demonstrates how **concise and efficient** Verilog becomes with reduction operators, especially for operations like **parity checking**, **population count**, or **bus status detection**, which would otherwise require verbose and error-prone logic.
