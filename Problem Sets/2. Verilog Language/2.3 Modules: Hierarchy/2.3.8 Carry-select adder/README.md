## Module_CSelAdd â€“ 32-bit Carry Select Adder

This problem focuses on building a **faster 32-bit adder** using the **Carry Select Adder** technique to reduce delay caused by ripple carry propagation.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- A **Carry Select Adder (CSA)** improves performance by calculating both possible outcomes of a carry-in (`0` and `1`) *in parallel*, then selects the correct result using a **2-to-1 multiplexer**.
- The design includes:
  - **One `add16`** for the lower 16 bits (with `cin = 0`)
  - **Two `add16`s** for the upper 16 bits (one with `cin = 0`, one with `cin = 1`)
  - A **16-bit multiplexer** selects the correct upper sum and carry-out based on the lower adderâ€™s carry-out.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Build a **32-bit Carry Select Adder** using:

- 3 instantiations of `add16` (provided by HDLBits)
- Your own **16-bit 2:1 multiplexer**
- Inputs: `a[31:0]`, `b[31:0]`
- Output: `sum[31:0]`
