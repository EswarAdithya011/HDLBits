## Module_Name â€“ Module Instantiation with Named Port Mapping

This problem is a continuation of module instantiation with a focus on **connecting ports by name**, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **Named port mapping** connects signals to module ports using their names.
- Syntax: `modulename instance_name (.port_name(signal_name), ...)`
- This method is **less error-prone** and more adaptable to port list changes than positional mapping.
- You will instantiate `mod_a` and connect its ports to top-level module ports as per the given mapping.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Create a module that:

- Has 6 ports: inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and outputs `out1`, `out2`
- Instantiates `mod_a` using **named port mapping** as follows:

| `mod_a` Port | `top_module` Port |
|--------------|-------------------|
| out1         | out1              |
| out2         | out2              |
| in1          | a                 |
| in2          | b                 |
| in3          | c                 |
| in4          | d                 |

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Using named connections improves **readability** and **code maintenance**, especially for large modules with many ports.
