## Norgate â€“ Logical NOR

The NOR gate is a universal logic gate that outputs a high signal (`1`) only when **both** inputs are low (`0`). It combines an OR gate followed by an inverter, making it a fundamental element for constructing any digital logic system.

### Problem Statement  
Design a Verilog module to implement a 2-input NOR gate. The output must be the logical negation of the OR result between inputs `a` and `b`.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
In Verilog, a NOR operation is written by first applying the OR operator (`|` or `||`) and then negating the result using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`). This models the NOR behavior in a single continuous assignment.

ðŸ›  *Design Note:*  
The `assign` keyword is used to define a continuous assignment in Verilog, which keeps the output dynamically updated based on input changes. This reflects how physical NOR gates function in real hardware.
