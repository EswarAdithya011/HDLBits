## Notgate â€“ Inverter

This fundamental exercise focuses on designing a basic digital logic component: the **NOT gate**. While conceptually simple, inverters are one of the most essential elements in any digital system. They are used in signal conditioning, control logic, and clock inversion circuits.

### Problem Statement  
Implement an inverter circuit using Verilog HDL. The module must invert the input signal and assign the result to the output. Use a continuous assignment to achieve this behavior.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
In Verilog, `assign` statements represent continuous assignments, ensuring that output logic always reflects any changes to the input in real-time, akin to actual physical hardware behavior.
