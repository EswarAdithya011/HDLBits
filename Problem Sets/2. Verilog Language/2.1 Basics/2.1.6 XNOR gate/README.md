## Xnorgate â€“ Logical XNOR

The **XNOR (Exclusive-NOR)** gate is a fundamental digital logic component that outputs high (`1`) only when both input values are the sameâ€”either both `0` or both `1`. It is essential in digital comparators, parity circuits, and control systems where equality checks are required.

### Problem Statement  
Construct a 2-input XNOR gate using Verilog HDL. The output must be high when inputs `a` and `b` are logically equivalent and low otherwise.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
This exercise highlights compound logic operations using Verilogâ€™s bitwise operators. An XNOR can be expressed by inverting the result of an XOR operation, showcasing how basic operators can be combined for more complex logic synthesis.
