## Wire Decl â€“ Internal Signal Declaration

As digital designs grow in complexity, intermediate signals become essential for connecting logic blocks within a module. Declaring internal wires in Verilog provides the flexibility to modularize combinational circuits and organize logic paths clearly.

---

### Problem Statement  
Design a combinational circuit with multiple logic gates, using internal wires to connect intermediate signals. Specifically, implement a circuit that uses **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** gates, ensuring correct internal wiring declarations.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
While input and output ports are implicitly treated as wires, internal connections require explicit wire declarations. This exercise demonstrates how internal logic can be structured using `wire` types, reinforcing the one-driver principleâ€”each wire should be driven by exactly one source.
