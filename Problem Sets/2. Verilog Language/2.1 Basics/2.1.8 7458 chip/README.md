## 7458 â€“ Logic Gate Combination Chip

The **7458** chip integrates **four 2-input AND gates** and **two 2-input OR gates** in a single module, commonly used in classic combinational digital systems. Modeling such chips in Verilog builds a strong understanding of gate-level abstraction and the wiring required between components.

---

### ðŸ§© Problem Statement  
Construct a Verilog module replicating the structure and functionality of the 7458 chip. It accepts ten input signals and produces two output signals:

- The first four AND gates take combinations of the first six inputs and feed into the `p1y` output through an OR gate.
- The remaining two AND gates take the next four inputs and produce the `p2y` output through another OR gate.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
This exercise emphasizes how **intermediate wires** act as internal connections between components. It also demonstrates how a collection of basic gates can be architected to form complex logic modules.

ðŸ›  *Design Notes:*  
- Reinforces the practice of structuring logic with clearly named intermediate wires.
- Useful for building confidence in organizing and debugging combinational circuits in HDL.
