## Andgate â€“ Logical AND

The AND gate is a foundational component in digital design, forming the basis of more complex operations like arithmetic logic, decision-making control paths, and combinational circuits.

---

### Problem Statement  
Construct a simple logic circuit that implements the behavior of an AND gate using Verilog HDL. The output should be driven high (`1`) only when **both** input signals `a` and `b` are high.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
Verilog allows bitwise (`&`) and logical (`&&`) operators. While both are valid for single-bit signals in this context, understanding their distinction is crucial for multi-bit or vector operations later on.

ðŸ›  *Design Note:*  
This exercise emphasizes signal driving in Verilog. Inputs are driven externally, while the output must be actively driven internally using a continuous assignment (`assign`). This teaches foundational concepts of driver-sink relationships and logic synthesis.
