## Vectorgates â€“ Bitwise & Logical Operations on Vectors

This exercise focuses on understanding the difference between **bitwise** and **logical** operators when used on vector signals in Verilog. You will also practice using vector indexing and part-select techniques to construct composite outputs.

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Operates on each corresponding bit of two vectors and produces a vector of the same width.  
  Example: `3'b101 | 3'b011 = 3'b111`
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Evaluates whether either vector is non-zero and returns a **single bit** (1 or 0).  
  Example: `3'b000 || 3'b011 = 1'b1`
- **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Inverts each bit individually.  
  Example: `~3'b101 = 3'b010`
- **Part-select**: Assign specific ranges of bits within a vector.  
  Example: `out_not[2:0] = ~a; out_not[5:3] = ~b;`

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Build a module with:

- Two **3-bit input vectors**: `a` and `b`  
- A **3-bit output vector** `out_or_bitwise` which performs a **bitwise OR** between `a` and `b`  
- A **1-bit output** `out_or_logical` which performs a **logical OR** between `a` and `b`  
- A **6-bit output vector** `out_not`:  
  - Bits `[5:3]` = bitwise NOT of `b`  
  - Bits `[2:0]` = bitwise NOT of `a`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This task helps build clarity on vector-based boolean operations in Verilog. Differentiating between logical and bitwise operators is crucial to avoiding simulation mismatches and synthesis issues. Using part-select boosts modular design and clarity.
