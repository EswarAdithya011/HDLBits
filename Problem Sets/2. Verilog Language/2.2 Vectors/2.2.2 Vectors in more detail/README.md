## Vector â€“ Grouping Related Signals Using Vectors

Vectors group related signals under a single name, simplifying manipulation and improving code readability. For example, `wire [7:0] w;` declares an 8-bit vector equivalent to eight individual wires.

### Problem Statement  
Design a combinational circuit that takes a 16-bit input half-word `[15:0]` and splits it into two separate bytes:

- Lower byte: bits `[7:0]`
- Upper byte: bits `[15:8]`

The circuit should output these two bytes separately.

ðŸ“˜ *Concept Insight:*  
Vectors in Verilog are declared as `type [upper:lower] vector_name;`, where `type` is usually `wire` or `reg`. The direction of the index (endianness) must remain consistent throughout the design. Accessing parts of vectors uses the part-select operator `[high_bit:low_bit]`. Understanding packed vs unpacked arrays, implicit nets, and correct vector slicing is essential to avoid bugs and ensure clear, modular code.

Proper use of vectors enables efficient data handling and signal grouping. Splitting vectors using part-select operators illustrates practical bit manipulation, common in digital design and interfacing tasks.
