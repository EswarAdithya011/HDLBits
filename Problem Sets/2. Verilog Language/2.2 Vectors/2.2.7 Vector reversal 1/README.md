## Vectorr â€“ Reversing Bit Order of an 8-bit Vector

This problem focuses on reversing the order of bits within an 8-bit input vector, a fundamental operation for bit-level data manipulation.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- Verilog does not support direct reversal of vector bit ordering using simple ranges like `in[0:7]`.  
- The **concatenation operator `{}`** can be used to manually reverse bits by selecting individual bits in reverse order.  
- Efficient bit reversal is important in signal processing, communication protocols, and hardware interfacing.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Build a module with:

- An **8-bit input vector** `in`  
- An **8-bit output vector** `out` which reverses the bit ordering of `in`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Using concatenation to reverse bits simplifies the implementation, allowing a single assign statement instead of multiple individual bit assignments, which enhances code readability and maintainability.
