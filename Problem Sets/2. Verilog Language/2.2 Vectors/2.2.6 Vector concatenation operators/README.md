## Vector3 â€“ Concatenation and Part Selection in Vectors

This problem practices the use of vector concatenation and part selection in Verilog, essential for manipulating and rearranging bits efficiently.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **Concatenation (`{}`)** combines multiple vectors or bits into a larger vector.  
- **Part selection (`[high:low]`)** extracts specific bits from a vector.  
- Concatenation requires sized constants or vectors to avoid errors.  
- Concatenation and part selection can be used on both sides of an assignment for flexible bit manipulation.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Given six 5-bit input vectors `a, b, c, d, e, f` (total 30 bits), and four 8-bit output vectors `w, x, y, z` (total 32 bits), build a circuit that:

- Concatenates all six input vectors into one continuous vector  
- Appends two 1-bit constants (`1'b1, 1'b1`) at the end to make 32 bits  
- Splits this 32-bit vector into four 8-bit output vectors: `w, x, y, z`
