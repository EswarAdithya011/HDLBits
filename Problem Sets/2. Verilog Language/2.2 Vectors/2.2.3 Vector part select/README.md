## Vector2 â€“ Reversing Byte Order in a 32-bit Vector

A 32-bit vector can be viewed as containing 4 bytes (bits `[31:24]`, `[23:16]`, `[15:8]`, `[7:0]`). Build a circuit that reverses the byte ordering of the 4-byte word.

### Problem Statement  
Given a 32-bit input vector:

- `Aaaaaaaa Bbbbbbbb Cccccccc Dddddddd`

Output the bytes in reversed order:

- `Dddddddd Cccccccc Bbbbbbbb Aaaaaaaa`

This operation is useful for converting between different endianness formats, such as from little-endian (x86) to big-endian (network protocols).

ðŸ›  *Design Note:*  
Using the part-select operator `[high_bit:low_bit]` allows precise access and assignment of individual bytes within a 32-bit vector. Reversing byte order by swapping these byte slices is a fundamental operation in digital systems that handle multiple endianness standards.
