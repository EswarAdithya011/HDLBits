## Gates4 â€“ 4-Input Logic Gates

This problem involves building a combinational circuit that takes a 4-bit input vector and computes the AND, OR, and XOR of all four bits.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **AND Gate (`&`)**: Produces 1 if all inputs are 1, otherwise 0.  
- **OR Gate (`|`)**: Produces 1 if any input is 1, otherwise 0.  
- **XOR Gate (`^`)**: Produces 1 if an odd number of inputs are 1, otherwise 0.  
- Applying these operators to a vector applies the operation across all bits, reducing the vector to a single bit output.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Build a combinational circuit with:

- A **4-bit input vector** `in`  
- Three **1-bit outputs**:  
  - `out_and` â€“ result of ANDing all 4 bits of `in`  
  - `out_or` â€“ result of ORing all 4 bits of `in`  
  - `out_xor` â€“ result of XORing all 4 bits of `in`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise reinforces the concept of reduction operators in Verilog which apply bitwise logic across all bits of a vector, producing a single output bit. Understanding these helps in efficient hardware design for condition checks and parity computations.
