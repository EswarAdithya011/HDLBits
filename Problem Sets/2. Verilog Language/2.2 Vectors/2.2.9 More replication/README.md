## Vector5 â€“ Pairwise Comparisons Using Replication and Concatenation

This problem requires computing all pairwise comparisons between five 1-bit signals and outputting a 25-bit vector where each bit indicates equality of the compared pair.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- The output is a **25-bit vector** representing all pairwise equality comparisons of inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.  
- Each bit is 1 if the corresponding two inputs are equal, 0 otherwise.  
- Using **replication `{}`** and **concatenation `{}`** operators simplifies building the input vectors for comparison.  
- The top vector replicates each input 5 times, and the bottom vector concatenates the five inputs repeated 5 times, allowing a single bitwise XNOR operation to perform all comparisons simultaneously.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
Build a module with:

- Five **1-bit inputs**: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`  
- A **25-bit output vector** `out` where each bit `out[i]` indicates whether the respective pair of inputs are equal.
