# Step One ‚Äì Getting Started

Getting started in digital logic design can be overwhelming at first because you need to learn new concepts, a new Hardware Description Language (e.g., Verilog), several new software tools, and often an FPGA board‚Äîall at once. This task provides a simple way to practice designing and debugging basic circuits efficiently.

Designing a circuit typically involves the following steps:
- Writing HDL (Verilog) code
- Compiling the code to produce a circuit
- Simulating the circuit and resolving any issues

## Writing Code
The best way to start is by using a code editor. For this task, most of the boilerplate was pre-filled. The remaining logic was completed based on the circuit‚Äôs functionality.

---

## Compiling (Logic Synthesis)
The code is compiled using synthesis tools that convert HDL into a digital logic circuit. These tools generate messages and warnings. Reducing warnings is good practice, though not always necessary for basic problems.

---

## Simulation
Once compiled, the circuit is simulated with test cases. The simulation compares the output of your circuit with a reference to identify any mismatches. The waveform visualization includes:
- **Inputs**
- **Your Outputs**
- **Reference Outputs**
- **Mismatch Indicators**

A correct circuit will have all outputs match exactly with the reference design.

---

## Final Status
Possible outcomes after simulation:
- ‚úÖ **Success!** ‚Äî Your circuit is correct.
- ‚ùå **Compile Error** ‚Äî Your code failed to compile.
- ‚ùó **Simulation Error** ‚Äî Compiled, but simulation did not complete.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Incorrect** ‚Äî Outputs didn‚Äôt match the expected behavior.

---

## Problem Statement
Build a circuit with no inputs and one output.  
That output should always drive logic high (1).
