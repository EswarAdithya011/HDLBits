### Problem Title: Simulation-Based Circuit Identification â€“ Circuit 2

**Problem Statement**  
You are given a combinational circuit with unknown internal logic. The task is to determine its functionality by analyzing the provided simulation waveforms. Based on the observed input-output relationships, implement a Verilog module that replicates the exact behavior of the circuit.

**Concept Insight**  
This problem focuses on waveform-based reverse engineering. By examining patterns between `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `q`, the underlying logic expression can be deduced without direct access to the original design.
