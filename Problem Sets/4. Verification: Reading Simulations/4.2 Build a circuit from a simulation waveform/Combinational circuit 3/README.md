### Problem Title: Simulation-Based Circuit Identification â€“ Circuit 3

**Problem Statement**  
A combinational circuit is provided with four inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and one output (`q`). Using the given simulation waveforms, deduce the logic function implemented by the circuit and write the corresponding Verilog implementation.

**Concept Insight**  
This task focuses on waveform analysis to reconstruct the Boolean expression that drives the output. The process involves tracking input changes and corresponding output transitions to identify logical operations.
