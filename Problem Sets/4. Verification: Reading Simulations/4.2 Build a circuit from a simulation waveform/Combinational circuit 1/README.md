### Problem Title: Simulation-Based Circuit Identification â€“ Circuit 1

**Problem Statement**  
You are given a combinational circuit with unknown internal logic. The functionality of the circuit must be deduced from provided simulation waveforms. After analyzing the timing diagram, implement the equivalent Verilog code that replicates the observed input-output behavior.

**Concept Insight**  
By carefully comparing inputs and outputs in the simulation, we can determine whether the circuit implements a logical, arithmetic, or bitwise operation. This type of problem tests waveform analysis skills and the ability to reverse-engineer digital logic from behavioral data.

**Design Note**  
The solution is derived entirely from waveform observation and does not require any provided original source code. The implemented circuit exactly matches the simulated behavior.
