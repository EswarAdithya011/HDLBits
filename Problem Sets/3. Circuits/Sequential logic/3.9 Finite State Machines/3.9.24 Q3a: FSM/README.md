## ðŸ§  Problem: 3-bit Window Detector (z=1 if w=1 occurs exactly twice every 3 cycles)
**Problem Statement:**  
Design a finite state machine with two inputs `s` and `w`, and one output `z`. The FSM starts in state A and remains in A as long as `s = 0`. When `s = 1`, it moves to state B. From state B onward, it inspects the value of `w` over the next 3 clock cycles. If `w = 1` occurs **exactly two times** in those 3 cycles, then `z` should be `1` in the **next clock cycle**, else `z = 0`. This 3-cycle grouping continues indefinitely.

**FSM Type:** Moore Machine  
**Reset Type:** Synchronous  
**Minimum State Requirement:** Encode count of `w=1` occurrences and cycle position using as few states as possible.
