### ðŸ§  Problem Title: FSM - 3-Device Arbiter  
---

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
This FSM acts as an **arbiter circuit**, controlling access to a shared resource between **three devices**. Each device sends a request through signal `r[i] = 1`, where `i âˆˆ {1,2,3}`. The FSM grants access using signal `g[i] = 1`. Devices are prioritized with device 1 having the highest and device 3 the lowest. The FSM remains in **state A** as long as there are no requests. When a request is received, it transitions to the corresponding grant state based on priority and stays there as long as that device keeps requesting.

- If multiple devices request at the same time, the **device with the highest priority gets the grant**.
- Once a device is granted, it retains the grant as long as it holds the request (`r[i] = 1`).
- FSM returns to state A when no device requests.

---

### ðŸ§® Concept Insight  
- **FSM type**: Mealy/Moore-like logic for priority-based grant.
- **Priority Encoding**: Handled in state transition using nested conditions.
- **Grant Output**: Depends on state â†’ `g[i] = 1` if in grant state for device `i`.
- **Design Pattern**: Synchronous reset, state register + next state logic, output logic separated.

### ðŸ“Š Design Note  
- **States Used**:  
  - A: Idle (no request)  
  - B: Grant to device 1  
  - C: Grant to device 2  
  - D: Grant to device 3  

- **State Transition**:  
  - A â†’ B if `r[1]`  
  - A â†’ C if `~r[1] & r[2]`  
  - A â†’ D if `~r[1] & ~r[2] & r[3]`  
  - Grant states loop on self while request held  
  - Else return to A  

- **Grant Output Mapping**:  
  ```verilog
  assign g = { (state == D), (state == C), (state == B) };
