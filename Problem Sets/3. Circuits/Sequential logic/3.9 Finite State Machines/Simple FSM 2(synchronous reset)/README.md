## fsm2s â†’ `Synchronous JK-Based Moore FSM (JK Flip-Flop Implementation)`

Design a **2-state Moore FSM** that mimics **JK flip-flop behavior** using:

- **Synchronous reset**
- Two input controls (`j` and `k`)
- One output (`out`) based solely on the current state

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight

This FSM acts like a **JK flip-flop**, where transitions are governed by the following:

| Current State | `j` | `k` | Next State |
|---------------|-----|-----|------------|
| OFF (0)       |  1  |  X  | ON (1)     |
| ON (1)        |  X  |  1  | OFF (0)    |
| Else          |     |     | Remains the same |

- **Output** is a Moore output (depends only on the current state)
- **Reset** is synchronous and always sends FSM to `OFF` on the next clock edge

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock
  - `reset`: Active-high **synchronous** reset to `OFF`
  - `j`: Set signal
  - `k`: Reset signal

- **Output**:
  - `out`: 1 if the FSM is in the `ON` state, 0 otherwise

### ðŸ›  Design Note

- **State Encoding**:
  - `OFF = 1'b0`
  - `ON  = 1'b1`

- **Reset Behavior**:
  - On `reset = 1`, state becomes `OFF` on the next `posedge clk`

- **State Transitions**:
  - From `OFF`: if `j = 1` â†’ go to `ON`, else stay
  - From `ON`: if `k = 1` â†’ go to `OFF`, else stay

- **Output**:
  - `out = 1` only when current state is `ON`
