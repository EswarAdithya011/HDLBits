# ðŸ§  Lemmings4 â€“ Finite State Machine with Fall Timer and Splatter State

Extend your FSM from previous Lemmings problems to model **splatter behavior**: if a Lemming **falls for more than 20 clock cycles** before hitting the ground, it splatters (dies). Upon splattering, **all outputs must stay at 0** forever until a reset occurs.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

A Lemming can **walk**, **fall**, or **dig**. But if it **falls for more than 20 cycles** and then hits the ground, it **splats** and all outputs remain 0 thereafter.

#### FSM Conditions:

- Inputs:
  - `clk`: Clock
  - `a`: At the edge
  - `b`: Ground present
  - `dig`: Dig command
- Outputs:
  - `walk_left`
  - `walk_right`
  - `aaah`
  - `digging`
- States:
  - Walking
  - Falling (`aaah`)
  - Digging
  - **Splattered**

ðŸŸ¥ You must:
- Count how long the Lemming is falling.
- If it falls more than 20 cycles, then hits the ground: transition to a permanent **splattered** state.
- In splattered state, all outputs = 0 until reset.

### ðŸ§© Concept Insight

- Use a **counter** to track how many cycles the FSM stays in the falling state.
- Trigger the **splatter transition** only when the Lemming is falling **and** hits the ground after >20 cycles.
- After splatter, use a **"trap" state** (e.g., `SPLAT`) to ensure FSM outputs stay at 0.
- Reset condition should return FSM back to normal starting state.

### ðŸ›  Design Note

This problem introduces **timed transitions** in FSMsâ€”a fundamental technique when modeling time-based events (e.g., timeouts, fall duration). It also demonstrates **state permanence** by trapping in a dead state (splattered) using conditional logic and counters. Managing this cleanly without unintended behavior requires careful reset and counter design.
