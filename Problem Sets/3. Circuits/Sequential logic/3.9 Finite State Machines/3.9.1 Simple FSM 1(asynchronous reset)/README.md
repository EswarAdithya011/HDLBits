## fsm1 â†’ `Moore FSM with Asynchronous Reset â€“ 2-State Toggle FSM`

Design a **Moore finite state machine** with the following features:
- **Two states**: A and B
- **One input**: `in`
- **One output**: `out`
- **Asynchronous reset** to state **B**
- **Behavior**: The state toggles based on input, and output depends only on the current state

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight

- This FSM behaves like a **T-type flip-flop with inverted T input**.
- **State A**: `out = 1`
- **State B**: `out = 0`
- On each clock cycle:
  - If `in = 1`, the FSM toggles its state
  - If `in = 0`, the FSM holds its state
- The reset is **asynchronous**, meaning the FSM jumps to **state B** immediately when `areset = 1`, regardless of clock

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal
  - `areset`: Asynchronous active-high reset to **state B**
  - `in`: Control signal that decides whether to toggle state

- **Output**:
  - `out`: Output depends only on the current state (Moore machine)
