# FSM: Sequence Detector (101) â€“ Mealy Machine

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Design a **Mealy-type Finite State Machine (FSM)** to detect the bit sequence `"101"` on an input signal named `x`. The FSM must assert an output signal `z` to logic-1 **when the sequence "101" is detected**.

Additional specifications:
- The FSM should recognize **overlapping sequences** (e.g., input `10101` should detect two sequences).
- The FSM should use **only 3 states**.
- The reset signal `aresetn` is an **active-low asynchronous reset**.

## ðŸ“š Concept Insight

A Mealy FSM generates outputs based on both the current state and current inputs. Recognizing the `"101"` pattern with 3 states requires:
- Efficient state transitions to support overlapping sequence detection.
- Careful state assignments to meet the 3-state constraint.
- Active-low reset control logic to initialize the FSM properly.
