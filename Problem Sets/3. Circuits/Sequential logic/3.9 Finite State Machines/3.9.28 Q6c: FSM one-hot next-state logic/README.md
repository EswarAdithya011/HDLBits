**Next-State Logic Using One-Hot State Assignment**

## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement  
**HDLBits â†’ Exams/m2014_q6c**

Consider the finite state machine shown in the diagram (not displayed here), which has one input `w` and one output `z`.

For this part, assume that a **one-hot encoding** is used with the following state assignment:

- State A: `y[6:1] = 000001`
- State B: `y[6:1] = 000010`
- State C: `y[6:1] = 000100`
- State D: `y[6:1] = 001000`
- State E: `y[6:1] = 010000`
- State F: `y[6:1] = 100000`

You are required to derive logic expressions for the next-state signals:
- `Y2` (next-state signal for state B)
- `Y4` (next-state signal for state D)

Derive the logic equations **by inspection** assuming a one-hot encoding.  
The testbench will test with non-one-hot inputs to ensure that your design logic doesnâ€™t depend on more than necessary.

## âœ… Design Note  
- In **one-hot encoding**, only one bit in the state vector `y[6:1]` is high at any time.
- From the FSM diagram:
  - `Y2` (next-state signal for state B) becomes active when **current state is A (y[1]) and w = 0**.
  - `Y4` (next-state signal for state D) becomes active when **current state is B, C, E, or F and w = 1**.
- So, the logic expressions are:
  - `Y2 = y[1] & ~w`
  - `Y4 = (y[2] | y[3] | y[5] | y[6]) & w`
