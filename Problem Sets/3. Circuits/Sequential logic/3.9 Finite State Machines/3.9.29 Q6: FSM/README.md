# FSM Design: Exams/m2014_q6

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Design a finite state machine based on the state diagram provided. The FSM has a single input `w` and a single output `z`. Implement this FSM using synchronous reset logic. This problem reinforces FSM design by modeling its states, transitions, and output behavior in Verilog.

                        | D |

Output `z = 1` when in states `E` or `F`, otherwise `z = 0`.

## ðŸ§¾ Design Note

This FSM uses six named states encoded as 3-bit binary values. The design consists of three main components:

- **State Encoding:** Six unique binary codes for each state.
- **Next-State Logic:** A combinational logic block that determines the next state based on the current state and input `w`.
- **State Register:** A clocked sequential block that updates the state on the rising edge of the clock, with synchronous reset.
- **Output Logic:** Combinational logic that sets `z = 1` for terminal states `E` and `F`.
