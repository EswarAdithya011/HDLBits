### âœ… Problem Title  
**Finite State Machine Design (Synchronous FSM with 6 States)**

---

### ðŸ“„ Problem Statement  
Given a 6-state FSM diagram, write a complete Verilog code that models the finite state machine. The FSM should be implemented using:
- Separate always blocks for **state transition logic** and **state register**.
- The output `z` can be implemented using either a continuous assignment or an always block.
- You may choose any binary encoding for the states.
- The reset signal is **synchronous and active-high**.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Concept Insight  
This is a **Mealy/Moore FSM** synthesis question from exam practice, focusing on:
- Correct usage of state registers and next-state logic.
- Designing FSMs using separate combinational and sequential logic blocks.
- Practicing FSM output generation based on specific states.

### ðŸ§  Design Note  
- Six states were named Aâ€“F and encoded as 3-bit binary values.
- The **next state logic** was implemented using a combinational `always @(*)` block.
- The **state register update** uses a synchronous process triggered on `posedge clk`.
- The output `z` is set high when the FSM is in state E or F.
- This FSM tests both transitions and output conditions across multiple paths, reinforcing strong FSM design fundamentals.
