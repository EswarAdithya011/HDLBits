## Count1to10 â€“ Decade Counter (1 to 10)

This module implements a **4-bit synchronous decade counter** that cycles through **1 to 10** (inclusive). After reaching 10, the counter wraps back to 1. The counter includes an active-high synchronous reset that also resets it to 1.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- Unlike a standard binary counter that starts from 0, this one starts and resets to **1**
- Once it reaches **10**, it rolls back to 1 manually
- The `reset` and `q == 10` conditions are merged using logical OR

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Clock input  
  - `reset`: Synchronous reset input  
- **Output**:  
  - `q[3:0]`: 4-bit counter output cycling from 1 to 10

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This counter avoids using modulus operations and directly uses comparison for wrapping. It's ideal for decoders or BCD systems where the count range is explicitly bounded between 1 and 10.
