## Count10 â€“ 4-Bit Synchronous Decade Counter (Modulo-10)

This module implements a **4-bit synchronous decade counter** that cycles from 0 to 9 and then wraps back to 0. The counter includes an active-high synchronous reset.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- Counter counts from **0 to 9** (decimal), then resets to 0
- Reset is **synchronous**, acting only on the rising edge of the clock
- Counter wraps manually using a conditional check: `q == 9`

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Clock input  
  - `reset`: Synchronous active-high reset  
- **Output**:  
  - `q[3:0]`: 4-bit counter output cycling from 0 to 9

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This design illustrates how to implement custom modulus counters in Verilog. Instead of allowing natural overflow (as in power-of-two counters), a specific condition (`q == 9`) is used to reset manually after reaching the maximum count.
