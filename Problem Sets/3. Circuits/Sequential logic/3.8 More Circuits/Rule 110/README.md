## rule110 â†’ `1D Cellular Automaton â€“ Rule 110 Implementation`

Design a **512-bit cellular automaton** that evolves according to **Rule 110**.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight

- **Rule 110** is a **Turing-complete** cellular automaton.
- It exhibits complex, self-replicating patterns from simple rules.
- Each cell's **next state** is computed from its **left**, **center**, and **right** neighbors.

Rule 110 transition table:

| Left | Center | Right | Next |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| 1    | 1      | 1      | 0    |
| 1    | 1      | 0      | 1    |
| 1    | 0      | 1      | 1    |
| 1    | 0      | 0      | 0    |
| 0    | 1      | 1      | 1    |
| 0    | 1      | 0      | 1    |
| 0    | 0      | 1      | 1    |
| 0    | 0      | 0      | 0    |

This binary truth table represents the value `8'b01101110`, which is `8'h6E` = `110` in decimal, hence **Rule 110**.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock input to update the system at each cycle
  - `load`: Load the initial state when high
  - `data[511:0]`: Initial cell configuration

- **Output**:
  - `q[511:0]`: Current cell configuration of the 512-bit system
