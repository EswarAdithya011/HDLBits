Transition Capture with Synchronous Reset

This module detects **falling edges (1â†’0)** for each bit in a 32-bit vector and **captures them permanently** until a synchronous reset clears them.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
Each bit behaves like an **SR flip-flop**:  
- **Set** condition: Detected on a falling edge (`prev_in = 1`, `in = 0`)  
- **Reset** condition: Occurs when `reset = 1` during a rising clock edge  
- Set is latched using: `out <= out | (~in & prev_in);`  
- Reset has precedence over set

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Clock signal  
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset  
  - `in[31:0]`: 32-bit input vector  
- **Output**:  
  - `out[31:0]`: Latched vector capturing 1â†’0 transitions per bit

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This type of circuit is useful for **event capture**, **fault detection**, or **flagging condition loss** until explicitly cleared by reset. It models an **edge-triggered event memory** with reset dominance.
