## DualEdge â€“ Emulating Dual-Edge Triggered Flip-Flop in FPGA

This module functionally mimics a **dual-edge triggered flip-flop** using separate flip-flops triggered on the positive and negative edges of the clock. Since real FPGAs don't support dual-edge triggering natively, we emulate it using two DFFs and a clock-dependent multiplexer.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- One register captures the value of `d` on the **positive edge**
- Another captures the value on the **negative edge**
- A **combinational mux** selects between them depending on the clock level
  - `q = q_temp[0]` when `clk = 1`  
  - `q = q_temp[1]` when `clk = 0`

This way, a value change on either edge of `clk` updates `q`.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Clock signal (dual-edge behavior to be emulated)  
  - `d`: Input data  
- **Output**:  
  - `q`: Output which reflects `d` on **both edges of `clk`**

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This is a clever hardware emulation technique for dual-edge triggering when you're restricted to single-edge DFFs. Itâ€™s practical for test benches or behavioral simulation but avoid using this style in critical FPGA logic due to timing uncertainty and possible glitches.
