## DFF8AR â€“ 8-Bit D Flip-Flop with Active High **Asynchronous Reset**

This module implements **8 positive edge-triggered D flip-flops**, each with an **active high asynchronous reset**. If `areset` is asserted, the output resets **immediately** to 0, regardless of the clock.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
- **Asynchronous reset**: The reset takes effect **immediately** upon being high, independent of the clock.  
- Used in designs requiring immediate reset behavior (e.g., power-on reset).  
- In Verilog, this is modeled using `always @(posedge clk or posedge areset)`.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Positive-edge clock  
  - `areset`: Active-high asynchronous reset  
  - `d[7:0]`: 8-bit input data  
- **Output**:  
  - `q[7:0]`: 8-bit output

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Asynchronous resets are common in real-world RTL due to their predictable hardware behavior during unexpected power-up or fault conditions. However, they need careful timing to avoid metastability issues.
