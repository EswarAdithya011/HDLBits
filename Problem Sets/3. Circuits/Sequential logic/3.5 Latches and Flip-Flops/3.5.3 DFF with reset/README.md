## DFF8R â€“ 8-Bit D Flip-Flop with Synchronous Reset

This module implements an **8-bit register with synchronous reset**. Each flip-flop captures the value from input `d` on the **positive edge** of `clk`, unless the **synchronous reset** signal `reset` is asserted, in which case all outputs `q` are cleared to `0`.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A **synchronous reset** means the reset only takes effect **on the clock edge**, just like a data load. This ensures **predictable behavior in clocked systems**, especially when designing state machines or pipelines.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Clock signal  
  - `reset`: Active-high synchronous reset  
  - `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input  
- **Output**:  
  - `q[7:0]`: 8-bit data output

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Use synchronous reset when the reset condition must align with your systemâ€™s clock boundaries. This is important in pipelined or sequential systems where control must remain deterministic.
