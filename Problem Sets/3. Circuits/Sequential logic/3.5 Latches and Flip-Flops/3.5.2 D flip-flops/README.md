## DFF8 â€“ 8-Bit D Flip-Flop Register

This module implements a **register of 8 D flip-flops**. Each flip-flop captures one bit from the 8-bit input `d` on the **positive edge** of the clock signal `clk` and stores it in the corresponding bit of output `q`.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
An **8-bit register** is a group of 8 D flip-flops operating in parallel. This is a basic storage element in digital systems for holding 8-bit values such as bytes or instruction segments.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `clk`: Clock input (shared for all DFFs)  
  - `d[7:0]`: 8-bit data input  
- **Output**:  
  - `q[7:0]`: 8-bit data output holding the stored values

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Using `always @(posedge clk)` ensures all 8 bits are **synchronously updated**. This register can serve as part of a pipeline stage, counter, buffer, or memory interface.
