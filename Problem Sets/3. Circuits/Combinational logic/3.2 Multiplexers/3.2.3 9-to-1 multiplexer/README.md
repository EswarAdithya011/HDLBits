## Mux9to1v â€“ 9-to-1 Multiplexer (16-bit Vector)

This module implements a **16-bit wide 9-to-1 multiplexer**, controlled by a 4-bit `sel` signal. The multiplexer selects one of the 9 input vectors `a` through `i`. For `sel` values 9 through 15 (which are not used), the output defaults to all 1s.

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A case statement is ideal for handling multiple input selections based on a 4-bit selector.  
Each case from 0 to 8 routes the corresponding input vector to the output.  
Remaining selector values (9â€“15) are handled by default, ensuring no latch inference.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a` to `i`: Nine 16-bit input vectors  
  - `sel`: 4-bit selection input  
- **Output**:  
  - `out[15:0]`: Output vector selected from one of the inputs or set to 16'hFFFF for unused selectors

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise emphasizes proper **combinational design** using case statements, which are scalable and clean for large multiplexers. It also reinforces default-case handling to avoid **unintentional latch inference**.
