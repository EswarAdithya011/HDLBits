## 7420 â€“ Dual 4-Input NAND Gates

This task replicates the functionality of the 7420 integrated circuit, which contains two independent 4-input NAND gates.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A 4-input NAND gate performs the logic operation:  
`out = ~(a & b & c & d)`

The 7420 chip has two such gates:
- One with inputs: `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d` â†’ output: `p1y`
- One with inputs: `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d` â†’ output: `p2y`

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - Gate 1: `p1a`, `p1b`, `p1c`, `p1d`  
  - Gate 2: `p2a`, `p2b`, `p2c`, `p2d`  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `p1y`, `p2y`: Each the NAND of the respective group of 4 inputs
