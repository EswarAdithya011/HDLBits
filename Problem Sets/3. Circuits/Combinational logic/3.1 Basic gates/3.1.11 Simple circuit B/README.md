## mt2015_q4b â€“ XNOR Gate Implementation

This task is derived from the 2015 midterm, question 4, and is based on analyzing and replicating a waveform behavior that matches an XNOR gate.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
The XNOR (Exclusive-NOR) gate performs the logic operation:
- `z = ~(x ^ y)`  
- It outputs 1 when both inputs are equal (either 0-0 or 1-1).

XNOR gates are frequently used in equality comparison and parity checking circuits.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `x`, `y`: Single-bit inputs  
- **Output**:  
  - `z = x ~^ y` (XNOR of `x` and `y`)

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise highlights how specific logic gates correspond to observable patterns in waveforms. Recognizing this allows reverse-engineering from timing diagrams during debugging or analysis.
