## Gatesv â€“ Bitwise Neighbour Relationship Logic

This task focuses on analyzing relationships between each bit of a 4-bit input vector and its adjacent bits using bitwise logic operations.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
The circuit evaluates bitwise comparisons between neighboring bits in a 4-bit vector:

- `out_both[i] = in[i] & in[i+1]` â†’ Both current and left neighbor are 1  
- `out_any[i]  = in[i] | in[i-1]` â†’ Either current or right neighbor is 1  
- `out_different[i] = in[i] ^ in[(i+1)%4]` â†’ Wrap-around XOR for difference detection

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Input**: `in[3:0]` â€“ 4-bit vector  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `out_both[2:0]`: Each bit = `1` if in[i] and in[i+1] are both `1`  
  - `out_any[3:1]`: Each bit = `1` if in[i] or in[iâˆ’1] is `1`  
  - `out_different[3:0]`: Each bit = `1` if in[i] â‰  in[(i+1)%4]`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise demonstrates how to handle adjacent-bit logic comparisons and circular wrapping behavior. It's a fundamental concept useful in **rotating buffers**, **edge detection**, and **bit pattern comparison**.
