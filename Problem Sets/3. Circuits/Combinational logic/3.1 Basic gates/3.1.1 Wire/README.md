## Exams/m2014_q4h â€“ Simple Combinational Gate

This problem presents a **basic combinational logic circuit** to implement.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
Though the circuit diagram isn't shown here, HDLBits typically uses such exercises to test understanding of basic gates or synthesis logic with minimal inputs.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Input**:  
  - `in`: 1-bit input signal  
- **Output**:  
  - `out`: 1-bit output signal based on the logic diagram provided

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
The exact logic behavior for this module is derived from the given diagram in HDLBits. Since the input is a single bit, the output is likely based on a **NOT**, **buffer**, or any other unary operation. For such problems, always inspect the diagram carefully and trace signal flow before coding.
