## Gates â€“ Basic Logic Gate Combinations

This task focuses on implementing all basic logic gates in Verilog using just two input signals. It's a practical demonstration of how each logic operation behaves.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
You will implement the following logic operations between two inputs `a` and `b`:
- AND: `a & b`
- OR: `a | b`
- XOR: `a ^ b`
- NAND: `~(a & b)`
- NOR: `~(a | b)`
- XNOR: `~(a ^ b)`
- A AND-NOT B: `a & ~b`

These gates form the foundational logic operations in digital circuits.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a`, `b`: 1-bit signals  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `out_and`, `out_or`, `out_xor`, `out_nand`, `out_nor`, `out_xnor`, `out_anotb`: Logic gates as described above
