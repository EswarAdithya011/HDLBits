## Ringer â€“ Conditional Output Control for Call Notification

This problem simulates a decision logic used in cellphones to control call notifications based on user mode preference (vibrate or ring). The design ensures **mutual exclusivity**: only one output is high at any time when a call comes in.

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
The two control signals are:
- `ring`: Indicates whether there's an incoming call.
- `vibrate_mode`: User-selected mode for silent notification.

The output behavior must be:
- **If `ring` is 1 and `vibrate_mode` is 1 â†’ motor = 1, ringer = 0**
- **If `ring` is 1 and `vibrate_mode` is 0 â†’ ringer = 1, motor = 0**
- **If `ring` is 0 â†’ both motor and ringer = 0**

This ensures the device either rings **or** vibrates when there's a callâ€”never both.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `ring`: Incoming call indicator  
  - `vibrate_mode`: User mode preference  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `ringer`: Controls audio ringing  
  - `motor`: Controls vibration motor

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This task reinforces the principle of **mutually exclusive combinational logic**, often encountered in mode-selective circuits in embedded systems. Using only `assign` statements showcases declarative thinking required for synthesizable RTL logic.
