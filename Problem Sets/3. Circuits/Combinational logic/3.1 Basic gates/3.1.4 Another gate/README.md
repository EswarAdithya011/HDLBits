## Exams/m2014_q4f â€“ AND Gate with Inverted Input

This task focuses on implementing a logic gate configuration using **primitive gates** in Verilog.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
The output logic is defined as:  
`out = in1 & ~in2`  
This is an **AND gate** where the second input is first inverted. It is commonly used in conditional logic and enable circuits.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `in1`, `in2`: 1-bit signals  
- **Output**:  
  - `out`: Logical AND of `in1` and NOT of `in2`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Using the built-in `and` primitive allows direct gate-level implementation. Inversion using the unary `~` operator is cleanly integrated into the input connection, making it concise and synthesis-friendly.
