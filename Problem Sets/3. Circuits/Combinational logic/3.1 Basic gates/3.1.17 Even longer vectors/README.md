## Gatesv100 â€“ 100-Bit Neighbour Comparison Logic

This task extends the earlier concept (Gatesv) to a 100-bit vector, requiring efficient vector-based logic operations for analyzing relationships between adjacent bits.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
This problem applies **bitwise logical operations** across a 100-bit input vector to produce:

- Logical ANDs between adjacent left bits  
- Logical ORs between adjacent right bits  
- XORs to detect differences, with circular wrapping

Efficient hardware design prefers **vector operations** for scalability and clarity.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Input**: `in[99:0]` â€“ 100-bit vector  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `out_both[98:0]`: 1 if both `in[i]` and `in[i+1]` are 1  
  - `out_any[99:1]`: 1 if either `in[i]` or `in[iâˆ’1]` is 1  
  - `out_different[99:0]`: 1 if `in[i] â‰  in[(i+1)%100]`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This problem reinforces the use of **vector slicing** and **wrapping logic**. Efficiently computing adjacency logic at scale is key in **error detection**, **data scrambling**, and **rotating shift designs**.
