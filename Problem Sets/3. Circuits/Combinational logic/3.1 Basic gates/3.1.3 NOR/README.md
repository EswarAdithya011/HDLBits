## Exams/m2014_q4e â€“ 2-Input NOR Gate

This problem evaluates your understanding of **basic logic gates** using Verilog's built-in gate primitives.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A NOR gate outputs logic high (`1`) only when **both inputs are low (`0`)**. It is the negation of the OR operation:
- `out = ~(in1 | in2)`

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `in1`, `in2`: 1-bit inputs  
- **Output**:  
  - `out`: Result of NOR operation on `in1` and `in2`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Using Verilog's built-in `nor` primitive simplifies gate-level modeling and ensures precise logic synthesis. It is a direct and synthesis-friendly way to describe the gate's behavior without using assign statements or always blocks.
