## Popcount3 â€“ Population Count for 3-Bit Vector

This exercise focuses on building a simple **population count** (popcount) circuit, which counts how many bits in the input are set to '1'.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A **population count** circuit returns the number of high bits (`1`) in a binary vector.

For a 3-bit input `in[2:0]`, the result is a 2-bit output `out[1:0]` representing the number of 1's in the input.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**: `in[2:0]` â€“ a 3-bit input vector  
- **Output**: `out[1:0]` â€“ the number of 1's in the input vector (0â€“3)

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This design uses a **combinational always block** with conditional checks and increment logic to count set bits. It's an essential construct for **bit counting**, used in parity, error detection, and digital signal processing systems.
