## mt2015_q4 â€“ Hierarchical Design Using Submodules A and B

This problem is from the 2015 midterm (Question 4), where a hierarchical design combines logic from two previously defined submodules to form a composite circuit.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
This design leverages modularity by using two subcircuits:
- **Submodule A**: `z = (x ^ y) & x`  
- **Submodule B**: `z = ~(x ^ y)`  

These are instantiated and their outputs are combined using:  
`z = (w0 & w1) ^ (w0 | w1)`

This final expression simplifies to a specific logical function that processes the results of both submodules.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `x`, `y`: Single-bit binary inputs  
- **Output**:  
  - `z`: Result of combining submodule A and B outputs via: `(A(x, y) & B(x, y)) ^ (A(x, y) | B(x, y))`
