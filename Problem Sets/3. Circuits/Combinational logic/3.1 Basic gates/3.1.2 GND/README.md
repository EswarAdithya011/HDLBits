## Exams/m2014_q4i â€“ Constant Output Logic

This problem focuses on generating a **constant logic output** using Verilog constructs.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
You are expected to produce a fixed output value, which is common in test benches, simulation control circuits, or default states. The circuit diagram will likely depict a logic-0 or logic-1 output tied directly to a constant source.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Output**:  
  - `out`: A 1-bit output that is hard-wired to a logic constant

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
The circuit is purely combinational and doesnâ€™t depend on any inputs. This is typically used to verify basic synthesis capability and constant assignment in Verilog. Whether the requirement is logic-0 or logic-1, buffer gates or direct assignment can be used for synthesis-ready coding.
