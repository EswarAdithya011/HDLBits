## Adder3 â€“ 3-Bit Ripple-Carry Adder using Full Adders

This module builds a **3-bit ripple-carry adder** using three instances of a full adder (`fadd`). It adds two 3-bit binary numbers (`a` and `b`) along with an initial carry-in (`cin`) and produces a 3-bit sum and intermediate carry-outs.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A ripple-carry adder chains multiple full adders:
- Each full adder adds the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` plus the carry from the previous stage.
- Carries propagate from LSB to MSB.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a[2:0]`, `b[2:0]`: 3-bit binary numbers  
  - `cin`: Initial carry-in  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `sum[2:0]`: 3-bit sum  
  - `cout[2:0]`: Carry-outs from each full adder stage

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This exercise emphasizes **modular design** by instantiating full adders and connecting them sequentially. Understanding this ripple-carry structure is vital for scaling up to wider adders and optimizing arithmetic logic.
