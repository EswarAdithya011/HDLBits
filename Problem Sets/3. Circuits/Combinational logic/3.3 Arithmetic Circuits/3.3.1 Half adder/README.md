## Hadd â€“ Half Adder

This module implements a **Half Adder**, a fundamental building block in digital arithmetic circuits. It adds two single-bit binary numbers and produces a **sum** and a **carry-out**.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A Half Adder performs the following logic:
- `sum = a ^ b` â€ƒ(XOR gate)
- `cout = a & b` â€ƒ(AND gate)

Unlike a full adder, the half adder does **not** handle a carry-in input.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a`, `b`: 1-bit binary operands  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `sum`: Result of a + b without carry-in  
  - `cout`: Carry generated from a + b

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Half adders are commonly used in constructing full adders and larger adders like ripple-carry or carry-lookahead adders. They are also essential in multiplier circuits where partial product generation is involved.
