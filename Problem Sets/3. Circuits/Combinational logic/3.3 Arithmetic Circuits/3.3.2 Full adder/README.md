## Fadd â€“ Full Adder

This module implements a **Full Adder**, a key building block in binary addition circuits. It adds three 1-bit inputs â€” two operands and a carry-in â€” producing a **sum** and a **carry-out**.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
A Full Adder performs:
- `sum = a ^ b ^ cin` â€ƒ(3-bit XOR)
- `cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin)` â€ƒ(Majority logic for carry)

This allows carry propagation in multi-bit binary addition.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `a`, `b`: 1-bit operands  
  - `cin`: Carry-in from previous stage  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `sum`: Bit-wise sum result  
  - `cout`: Carry-out for next stage

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
Full adders are chained together to form ripple-carry adders or more efficient multi-bit adders. Mastering their implementation is foundational for digital arithmetic design.
