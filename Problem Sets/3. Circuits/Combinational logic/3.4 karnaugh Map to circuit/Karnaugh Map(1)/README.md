## Exams/m2014_q3 â€“ Karnaugh Map Based Logic Function

This module implements a logic function derived from a 4-variable Karnaugh map with some **don't-care** conditions. The final simplified expression is realized using standard logic operations.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
From the given K-map simplification:
- The logic function simplifies to:  
  `f = (~x[1] & x[3]) | (x[2] & x[4])`

---

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `x[4:1]`: A 4-bit vector input  
- **Output**:  
  - `f`: Output derived from simplified logic
