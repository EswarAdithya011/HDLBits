## Exams/ece241_2014_q3 â€“ Logic Implementation with 4-to-1 MUX and 2-to-1 MUXes

This module constructs the 4-to-1 multiplexerâ€™s input logic `mux_in[3:0]` based on the simplified **Karnaugh Map** function. Inputs `a` and `b` are assumed to be used as select lines for the 4-to-1 multiplexer, while `c` and `d` help generate the data inputs through minimal use of 2-to-1 multiplexers.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
Each `mux_in[i]` represents the function output when `a` and `b` equal `i`. Based on the K-map grouping, each expression is minimized using combinations of `c` and `d` only.  
This problem emphasizes **functional completeness using multiplexers only**.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `c`, `d`: Inputs for generating `mux_in`  
- **Outputs**:  
  - `mux_in[3:0]`: Inputs to a 4-to-1 MUX controlled externally by `a` and `b`

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This implementation focuses on deriving **minimal expressions for MUX inputs** using `c` and `d`, aligned with Karnaugh map groupings. It's a classic case of **MUX-based logic synthesis** using just data selectors, ideal for FPGA LUT modeling.
