## Exams/2012_q1g â€“ K-map Logic Function Implementation

This module implements a logic function based on a **4-variable Karnaugh map**, simplified to reduce the gate count while preserving correct logical behavior.

---

### ðŸ§  Concept Insight  
The Karnaugh map simplification yields the optimized Boolean expression:  
`f = (x[3] & (~x[1] | x[2] & x[4])) | (~x[2] & ~x[4])`  
This uses a mix of AND, OR, and NOT operations to represent grouped minterms.

### ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement  
- **Inputs**:  
  - `x[4:1]`: A 4-bit input vector  
- **Output**:  
  - `f`: Output determined by simplified logic expression

### ðŸ›  Design Note  
This task tests your ability to interpret a Karnaugh map and implement the **minimal logical expression** directly in Verilog. Efficient translation reduces circuit complexity and improves performance.
